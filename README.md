# Smooth Operators: LLMs Translating Imperfect Hints into Disfluency-Rich Transcripts
This repository contains the codes for the INTERSPEECH2025 workshop [DISS2025](https://diss2025.inesc-id.pt/) paper [Smooth Operators: LLMs Translating Imperfect Hints into Disfluency-Rich Transcripts](). 

## Overview

Our work presents a novel approach to detecting and transcribing disfluencies in spoken language using large language models (LLMs). By integrating acoustic representations with textual inputs—even if imperfect—we generate fully annotated transcripts with precise disfluency tokens and timestamps, advancing speech and language processing capabilities.

## Setup
For firing up the experiment run `run.sh` directly. Be careful that the script needs 2 GPUs, LLaMa and Conformer models will be placed to one GPU each.
